MERN Stack Hands-on Task:
You are required to build a Collaborative Document Annotation System using the MERN stack. This
problem is designed to test your end-to-end skills.

Requirements:
• Document Upload &amp; Storage: A user can upload text or PDF files.
• Annotation Feature: On the frontend, users should be able to select a portion of text in the
document and add annotations/comments. Each annotation should be linked to the exact text
range, user who made the annotation, and timestamp.
• Real-Time Collaboration: Multiple users can annotate the same document at the same time.
Annotations should appear in real time to all connected users.
• Handle large documents efficiently. Annotations should remain accurate even if multiple users
annotate overlapping text ranges. Prevent duplicate annotations for the same range by the same
user.
• Optimizations Expected:
Efficient MongoDB schema design.
Backend APIs with proper good performance.
I should not lag when loading documents with 1000+ annotations.
Proper error handling.

Deliverables:
• A working MERN app (doesn’t need to be production-grade but should show solid architecture).
• Backend: Node.js + Express APIs with MongoDB schema.
• Frontend: React app with annotation UI (highlight text, add comments, show comments in a side
panel).
• Real-time sync.
• Documentation: Short README explaining design choices (schema, performance optimizations,
edge case handling).
